Desktop notifications and sounds for **Claude Code and Codex CLI**. Know when a task finishes, an agent needs input, or a tool needs approval. Click a notification to return to work.

## Features

- **Task and attention alerts:** completions, reviews, questions, plans, session limits and API errors for Claude; completions and permission requests for Codex, with opt-in subagent alerts. [Event details](docs/NOTIFICATION_TYPES.md)
- **Click-to-focus:** return to the originating terminal or editor, with exact tab/pane targeting for supported integrations including Ghostty, iTerm2, Warp, tmux, kitty and WezTerm. [Supported terminals](docs/CLICK_TO_FOCUS.md)
- **Useful context:** project, git branch and session labels in notifications.
- **Custom sounds:** built-in or custom MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG and AIFF, with volume control, previews and audio output selection.
- **Less noise:** focus-aware delivery, optional delay, duplicate-question suppression, filters by status, branch or folder, and opt-in respect for the desktop's Do Not Disturb state. [Do Not Disturb](docs/DO_NOT_DISTURB.md)
- **Your settings per agent:** shared configuration with separate Claude and Codex overrides; control desktop and webhook delivery per status. [Agent settings](docs/AGENT_CONFIGURATION.md)
- **Webhooks:** Slack, Discord, Telegram, Lark/Feishu and custom endpoints, including Teams, ntfy, PagerDuty, Zapier, n8n and Make. Retries, rate limits and circuit breakers are built in. [Integrations](docs/webhooks/README.md)
- **Cross-platform:** macOS (Intel/Apple Silicon), Linux (x64/ARM64) and Windows 10+ (x64). [Platform details](docs/PLATFORMS.md)

[Codex setup and event behavior](docs/CODEX.md)

## Install Or Update

👉 **[Open the guided installer](https://777genius.github.io/agent-notifications/#install)**

On Windows, run the installer in **Git Bash**. Python is optional only for exact iTerm2 tab/pane targeting.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://777genius.github.io/agent-notifications/install.sh | bash
```

The short setup loader resolves the latest stable release and downloads the installer from that release's exact commit. Release lookup and validation happen automatically. Choose **Claude**, **Codex**, or **both**. For non-interactive setup, append `-s -- --product claude`, `codex`, or `both` after `bash`.

- **Claude:** restart Claude Code.
- **Codex:** restart Codex, open `/hooks`, then review and trust the installed hooks.

Run the same command to update. [Guided installer](https://777genius.github.io/agent-notifications/#install) · [Manual installation, updates and removal](docs/INSTALLATION.md)

## Settings

In Claude Code, run `/claude-notifications-go:settings` for the configuration wizard or `/claude-notifications-go:sounds` to browse and preview sounds.

The primary CLI is `agent-notifications`. Use `agent-notifications config path` to locate your settings and `agent-notifications config inspect --json` to inspect them safely. The `claude-notifications` alias and Claude slash-command namespace remain compatible with existing installations.

[Configuration reference](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) · [Per-agent overrides](docs/AGENT_CONFIGURATION.md) · [Sound previews](docs/interactive-sound-preview.md)

Codex requires a published stable plugin release v1.42.0 or newer. The installer downloads matching source and binaries, respects `CODEX_HOME`, and keeps a permanent runtime copy there. It reports an error if no supported release is published yet.

> If installation fails, use [manual Claude installation](#manual-install) or [manual Codex registration](#manual-codex-registration), depending on the product.

### Manual Install

<details>
<summary>Step-by-step installation inside Claude Code (if bootstrap doesn't work)</summary>

Run these slash commands in the Claude Code chat, not in your system terminal:

```text
# 1) Add marketplace
/plugin marketplace add 777genius/agent-notifications
# 2) Install plugin
/plugin install claude-notifications-go@claude-notifications-go
# 3) Restart Claude Code
# 4) Download binary
/claude-notifications-go:init
# 5) (Optional) Configure sounds and settings
/claude-notifications-go:settings
```

> **Compatibility:** `claude-notifications-go` is the frozen Claude Code marketplace,
> plugin, and command namespace. The public product is **Agent Notifications**, but changing
> these technical identifiers breaks existing installations and updates. See
> [Claude plugin identity compatibility](docs/CLAUDE_PLUGIN_IDENTITY.md).

</details>

> Having issues with installation? See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

### Updating

Run the same command and choose the product(s) you want to update:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://777genius.github.io/agent-notifications/install.sh | bash
```

For Claude, restart Claude Code. For Codex, restart Codex and inspect `/hooks`; changed hook definitions may need trust approval again. The installer refreshes the Codex runtime and registration automatically. Existing foreign hooks and shared settings in the file selected by `config path` are preserved.

<details>
<summary>Manual Claude update (if bootstrap didn't work)</summary>

Claude Code also periodically checks for plugin updates automatically. Binaries are updated on the next hook invocation when a version mismatch is detected.

To update manually via Claude Code UI:

1. Run `/plugin`, select **Marketplaces**, choose `claude-notifications-go`, then select **Update marketplace**
2. Select **Installed**, choose `claude-notifications-go`, then select **Update now**

If the binary auto-update didn't work (e.g. no internet at the time), run `/claude-notifications-go:init` to download it manually. If hook definitions changed in the new version, restart Claude Code to apply them.

</details>

### Uninstalling

**Claude:**

```text
/plugin uninstall claude-notifications-go@claude-notifications-go
```

Optionally also remove the marketplace registration: `/plugin marketplace remove claude-notifications-go`.

**Codex:** Codex has no plugin manager, so removal is manual. Delete the hook entries this installer added from `~/.codex/hooks.json` (`%USERPROFILE%\.codex\hooks.json` on Windows), then remove the installed copy at `~/.codex/claude-notifications-go` (`%USERPROFILE%\.codex\claude-notifications-go` on Windows). This does not touch hooks you registered yourself for other tools.

**Configuration:** uninstalling does not delete your saved settings. Run `agent-notifications config path` to find the active file, and remove it yourself if you no longer want it.

## Supported Notification Types

The Claude triggers are listed below. Codex uses a different event mapping, described in [Codex support](#codex-cli-support-beta).

| Status | Icon | Description | Trigger |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| Task Complete | ✅ | Main task completed | Stop/SubagentStop hooks (state machine detects active tools like Write/Edit/Bash, or ExitPlanMode followed by tool usage) |
| Review Complete | 🔍 | Code review finished | Stop/SubagentStop hooks (state machine detects only read-like tools: Read/Grep/Glob with no active tools, plus long text response >200 chars) |
| Question | ❓ | Claude has a question | PreToolUse hook (AskUserQuestion) OR Notification hook |
| Plan Ready | 📋 | Plan ready for approval | PreToolUse hook (ExitPlanMode) |
| Session Limit Reached | ⏱️ | Session limit reached | Stop/SubagentStop hooks (state machine detects "Session limit reached" text in last 3 assistant messages) |
| API Error | 🔴 | Authentication expired, rate limit, server error, connection error | Stop/SubagentStop hooks (state machine detects via `isApiErrorMessage` flag + `error` field from JSONL) |
| Permission Request | 🔐 | Codex is waiting for tool approval | Codex `PermissionRequest` hook (Codex only) |

## Codex CLI Support (beta)

The same binary can notify for OpenAI Codex CLI sessions.

### Setup

Use the [one-command installer](#quick-install-recommended) and choose Codex or both.
It downloads matching release source and binaries, registers the hooks, and keeps a stable
runtime copy. Then start Codex and approve the entries in `/hooks`.

### Manual Codex registration

Skip this section if you used the one-command installer. For manual setup, download a
matching release bundle and binary (v1.42.0 or newer). The Go registration command needs
no `jq` and is not automatically added to your `PATH`.

From the bundle directory:

```bash
./bin/agent-notifications setup-codex --plugin-root .
```

On Windows, run the installed primary launcher in PowerShell (the downloaded
`claude-notifications-windows-amd64.exe` remains compatible):

```powershell
.\bin\agent-notifications.bat setup-codex --plugin-root .
```

Run these commands in the bundle directory. If you have explicitly added the binary to
`PATH`, `agent-notifications setup-codex --plugin-root <bundle-directory>` also works.

It installs a self-contained copy of the plugin at `~/.codex/claude-notifications-go` and writes
the hook entries into `~/.codex/hooks.json`. Agent-initiated notify (MCP) is enabled by default
with `--navigation none --allow-unknown-caller true --allow-caller-asserted false`. Pass `--skip-agent-notify` for hooks only. Existing foreign hook
definitions and unknown fields are preserved, and every run saves a uniquely named backup of
the previous file next to it.

Then start Codex, run `/hooks`, review the entries and trust them. Open a new session so MCP
can start; `/mcp` should list `agent_notifications`.

Useful flags: `--dry-run` shows what would change, `--print` outputs the JSON so you can merge it
yourself, `--codex-home` and `--plugin-root` override the paths, `--skip-agent-notify` skips MCP
registration. If agent-notify setup fails, hook registration remains in place.

For manual updates, run the registration command again to refresh the installed copy.
Unchanged hook definitions retain trust; changed definitions require review again.
The one-command installer handles this registration step automatically.

Claude Code installation and updates continue to use the [one-command installer](#install-or-update).
Both products share settings at the shared file selected by `config path`; installing
Codex does not require installing Claude Code. Keep your existing settings file when updating.

<details>
<summary>How registration works</summary>

`setup-codex` registers user hooks explicitly, using a stable runtime directory independent
of the plugin cache. This is the setup path covered by this project's installer tests.
The bundle also includes a Codex plugin manifest. Codex versions can differ in plugin-hook
loading; follow the [current Codex hooks documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/hooks)
for native plugin setup. Use one registration path to avoid duplicate hooks, and inspect
`/hooks` after installation.

Codex includes the command string in its trust hash, so the registration deliberately points at
the stable `~/.codex/claude-notifications-go` copy rather than a versioned plugin cache
directory — that is what keeps the trust valid across updates.

</details>

What works today:

- **Stop** - a turn finishes; the status comes from the final assistant message: short failure
  reports map to the API Error / Session Limit statuses, a trailing question mark maps to
  Question, otherwise Task Complete. The Codex rollout transcript is not parsed (it is an
  internal, unstable format).
- **Question payloads (experimental)** - if Codex emits `PreToolUse` for `request_user_input`,
  the plugin delivers the question/header text. Options, ids, and secret fields are excluded.
  Live firing of this tool hook is not yet qualified; do not rely on it for every question.
- **PermissionRequest** - Codex is waiting for your approval of a tool call; delivered as the
  time-sensitive Permission Request status. Only the tool name is shown, never the tool input.
- **SubagentStop** (opt-in) - with `notifyOnSubagentStop: true` and `suppressForSubagents: false`,
  subagent completions notify with the subagent's final message.

Known limitations:

- PermissionRequest cannot fire when Codex never asks for approval (`bypassPermissions`,
  `--ask-for-approval never`, headless `codex exec`).
- The error statuses for Codex come from a text heuristic over the final message (short messages
  with failure phrasing), not from structured error data - false negatives are possible.
- The `request_user_input` question hook is limited to the modes where Codex exposes that tool.
- Windows support for the Codex route is not declared until the Windows launcher is proven.
- Codex hooks require a trust review (`/hooks` inside Codex); changed definitions require review again.

Both products share one config file (the shared file selected by `config path`).

## Platform Support

**Supported platforms:**
- macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon)
- Linux (x64 & ARM64)
- Windows 10+ (x64)

**No additional dependencies:**
- ✅ Binaries auto-download from GitHub Releases
- ✅ Pure Go - no C compiler needed

- System sounds not accessible - use built-in MP3s or custom files

### Click-to-Focus (macOS & Linux)

Clicking a notification activates your terminal window. Auto-detects terminal and platform.

**macOS** — via AX API with bundle ID detection:

| Terminal | Focus method |
|----------|-------------|
| Ghostty | Exact tab focus via Ghostty AppleScript, with AXDocument fallback |
| VS Code / Insiders / Cursor | AXTitle (focus-window subcommand) |
| iTerm2 | Exact tab/pane targeting via iTerm2 Python API when available, otherwise app-level iTerm activation |
| Warp | Exact window/tab/pane via `WARP_FOCUS_URL` (`warp://session/<uuid>`), AXTitle fallback on older Warp |
| kitty, WezTerm, Alacritty, Hyper, Apple Terminal | AXTitle (focus-window subcommand) |
| Any other (custom `terminalBundleId`) | AXTitle (focus-window subcommand) |

**Linux** — via D-Bus daemon with automatic compositor detection:

| Terminal | Supported compositors |
|----------|----------------------|
| VS Code | GNOME, KDE, Sway, X11 |
| Warp | GNOME, KDE, Sway, X11 — exact pane via `WARP_FOCUS_URL` |
| GNOME Terminal, Konsole, Alacritty, kitty, WezTerm, Tilix, Terminator, XFCE4 Terminal, MATE Terminal | GNOME, KDE, Sway, X11 |
| JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, PhpStorm, WebStorm, PyCharm, GoLand, …) | GNOME, KDE, Sway, X11 — the IDE window, not the terminal tab |
| Any other | Fallback by name |

Linux focus methods (tried in order): Warp session URL (`xdg-open`), GNOME extension, GNOME Shell Eval, GNOME FocusApp, wlrctl (Sway/wlroots), kdotool (KDE), xdotool (X11).

**Multiplexers** (both platforms): tmux (including iTerm2 -CC integration mode), zellij, WezTerm, kitty — click switches to the correct pane/tab.

**iTerm2 note:** to open the exact iTerm2 tab or split pane, enable `iTerm2 > Settings > General > Magic > Enable Python API`. If you just toggled it, restart iTerm2 once. Without the Python API, the plugin falls back to app-level iTerm activation instead of exact tab targeting.

**Windows** — clicking a notification raises the originating terminal **window** (Windows Terminal, VS Code, conhost, …) via a protocol-activated toast. Window-level only: tab/split-pane targeting isn't possible (one window hosts all tabs), and picking among multiple WT windows in one process is best-effort. See the guide for details.

See **[Click-to-Focus Guide](docs/CLICK_TO_FOCUS.md)** for configuration details.

## Configuration

The following workflow requires the coordinated config-capable runtime and installer; older releases may not provide these commands. Do not use a legacy full-file writer as a fallback.

Run `/claude-notifications-go:settings` to configure sounds, volume, webhooks, and other options via an interactive wizard. You can re-run it anytime to reconfigure.

### Manual Configuration

Use the installed config-capable executable (shown as `$NOTIFICATIONS_BIN` in recipes):

```bash
"$NOTIFICATIONS_BIN" config path --json
"$NOTIFICATIONS_BIN" config inspect --json
```

One file is selected per environment context: explicit **E**, otherwise existing **L**, otherwise **N**. Existing L is preserved; there is no automatic migration, copy, merge or synchronization.

| Selection | Native file path |
|---|---|
| E: `AGENT_NOTIFICATIONS_CONFIG` | An absolute **file**, not a directory |
| L: existing legacy file, macOS/Linux | `$HOME/.claude/claude-notifications-go/config.json` |
| L: existing legacy file, Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\claude-notifications-go\config.json` |
| N: fresh macOS | `$HOME/Library/Application Support/agent-notifications/config.json` |
| N: fresh Linux | Absolute nonempty `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agent-notifications/config.json`, otherwise `$HOME/.config/agent-notifications/config.json` |
| N: fresh Windows | `%APPDATA%\agent-notifications\config.json` |

Relative XDG_CONFIG_HOME is ignored with a diagnostic. Windows uses USERPROFILE for L, not Git Bash HOME; missing/relative APPDATA without L is an error. macOS ignores XDG_CONFIG_HOME. Missing home in automatic mode is an error; a valid explicit E supports portable contexts without HOME/APPDATA.

Unset E enables automatic selection; set-empty, whitespace-only, relative, `~/file` and invalid native paths are errors, never fallback. The resolver does not expand variables or tilde in E. Expand them in the calling shell if intended; Git Bash may use `cygpath -w` to supply a native absolute Windows path. Do not trim legitimate spaces in filenames.

For writable targets, `.lock` filenames and generated `.tmp-<32 hex digits>` / `.backup-<32 hex digits>` names are reserved for coordination and recovery metadata. Choose another filename for a portable config.

If L and N both exist, L wins with a diagnostic even if identical or N is newer. To intentionally select N, set E in **every** new adapter and CLI environment. Unsetting E restores legacy-first selection. Old binaries ignore E. `CODEX_HOME`, `CLAUDE_HOME`, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, product, cwd and bundle/install paths do not select notification config. They retain their resource/installation meanings; permission markers, venv and state paths do not move.

`config init` is create-only: existing valid config is a byte/mode/mtime-preserving no-op; invalid existing config is an error. Hooks never write config and use in-memory defaults only for truly missing automatic config after historical recovery checks. Explicit missing E, corrupt/unreadable canonical files and unresolved recovery artifacts are errors, with no bundle/default fallback.

Use the [settings recipe](commands/settings.md) for `config edit --stdin --expect-revision TOKEN`: private input, only requested JSON Pointer leaf edits, raw values, and an explicit user decision after any conflict. A volume plus one status sound edit preserves every other raw field, status, channel, webhook secret/payload and future-agent setting. Inspect is a safe projection, not a replacement document; absent free-form values are not unset.

Before any updater deletes/refreshes cache, personalized or unknown historical cache-only/custom-root settings require explicit import using a verified new helper: stop old writers, inspect the selected destination, then `config init --from FILE` only if that destination is missing. Never auto-copy a bundle, guess the newest cache, overwrite existing canonical config, or treat this as migration/reset. If preflight/helper is unavailable, stop the update and retain the old runtime. For existing invalid config, stop writers and explicitly repair/recover it while preserving damaged bytes; init cannot reset it.

Existing L with v1-shaped JSON remains readable by the old Go reader, which ignores additive unknown fields. The old wizard loses unknown fields and is an unsupported concurrent writer. N/E require a bridge-aware runtime, or explicit stopped-writer recovery to a single legacy canonical file with a private backup and all contexts switched; two live copies are not a workaround. No downloadable bridge release is promised here. Native Windows replacement/ACL, macOS/Linux crash/concurrency and OS E2E qualification remain release gates, not results established by this documentation patch.

For support, share only `config inspect --json`, never `cat` of config; keep saved diagnostics private and review paths before posting. The response includes selection (path/source/exists/diagnostics), revision, schemaVersion, valid, optional errorCode, and safe settings: desktopEnabled, desktopSound, volume and known-status enabled/desktopEnabled/webhookEnabled. It omits free-form sounds, webhook secrets/payloads and unknown fields.

The following JSON illustrates the schema. Do not replace your existing document with it; apply only explicitly requested leaf edits:

```json

  "notifications": {
    "desktop": {
      "enabled": true,
      "sound": true,

}
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `notifyOnSubagentStop` | `false` | Send notifications when subagents (Task tool) complete. Has no effect unless `suppressForSubagents` is also set to `false`. |
| `suppressForSubagents` | `true` | Suppress subagent (`SubagentStop`) notifications, plus any `Stop` notification whose transcript is a subagent/teammate transcript. Detection uses the hook event for `SubagentStop` (Claude Code passes the parent session `transcript_path` to that hook, so a path check alone can't identify it). Set to `false` together with `notifyOnSubagentStop: true` to get a notification each time a subagent finishes. |
| `notifyOnTextResponse` | `true` | Send notifications for text-only responses (no tool usage) |
| `desktop.showSessionLabel` | `true` | Append the `[name id]` session label to the notification title. |
| `respectJudgeMode` | `true` | Honor `CLAUDE_HOOK_JUDGE_MODE=true` env var to suppress notifications |
| `notifyOnlyWhenUnfocused` | `false` | Skip the desktop notification only when the focused terminal window can be matched to the current Claude Code session. Best-effort per platform; if focus can't be determined the notification is still shown. |
| `notifyDelaySeconds` | `0` | Wait N seconds before delivering a desktop notification (capped at 25s by the hook timeout). With `notifyOnlyWhenUnfocused`, focus is re-checked after the wait. Webhooks are unaffected. |
| `suppressQuestionAfterTaskCompleteSeconds` | `12` | Suppress question notifications for N seconds after task complete |
| `suppressQuestionAfterAnyNotificationSeconds` | `7` | Suppress question notifications for N seconds after any notification |
| `suppressFilters` | `[]` | Array of rules to suppress notifications by status, git branch, and/or folder. Each rule is an AND of its fields; omitted fields match any value. Set `gitBranch` to `""` to match sessions outside git repos. |

Each status can be individually disabled by adding `"enabled": false`.

You can also override individual channels per status:

```json
{
  "statuses": {
    "question": {
      "title": "❓ Question",
      "sound": "${AGENT_NOTIFICATIONS_ROOT}/sounds/question.mp3",
      "desktop": { "enabled": true },
      "webhook": { "enabled": false }
    }
  }
}
```

`statuses.<name>.enabled` is still the master switch for both channels. Use
`desktop.enabled` and `webhook.enabled` when you want one channel on and the
other off for the same status.

### Focus-Aware & Delayed Notifications

Two independent options cut notification noise when you're already watching the terminal:

- **`notifyOnlyWhenUnfocused`** - skip the desktop notification only when the focused terminal window can be matched to the current Claude Code session.
- **`notifyDelaySeconds`** - wait N seconds before delivering, so a quick task can finish before any banner appears (capped at 25s to stay within the hook timeout).

They compose: with both set, the plugin waits, then notifies only if the terminal still isn't focused - "tell me once I've looked away."

```json
{
  "notifications": {
    "notifyOnlyWhenUnfocused": true,
    "notifyDelaySeconds": 10
  }
}
```

Both apply to **desktop notifications only** - webhook delivery is never delayed or suppressed. Focus detection is best-effort and degrades safely by notifying when unsure:

- macOS: Ghostty can be matched by exact terminal/session metadata; other terminal apps require the frontmost window title to match the project folder and existing Screen Recording access.
- Linux: X11 sessions compare `$WINDOWID` to the active window. In JetBrains IDE terminals the active window must belong to the IDE process and its title must name the project (KDE Plasma: `kdotool`, X11: `xdotool`); an inherited `$WINDOWID` is ignored there. Other Wayland sessions and terminals without `$WINDOWID` are treated as unknown.
- Windows: the foreground window must belong to the hook process ancestry and its title must contain the project folder. Ambiguous multi-window or multi-tab terminal hosts are treated as unknown.

Unknown means "show the notification", not "suppress it".

### Sound Options

**Built-in sounds** (included):
- `${AGENT_NOTIFICATIONS_ROOT}/sounds/task-complete.mp3`
- `${AGENT_NOTIFICATIONS_ROOT}/sounds/review-complete.mp3`
- `${AGENT_NOTIFICATIONS_ROOT}/sounds/question.mp3`
- `${AGENT_NOTIFICATIONS_ROOT}/sounds/plan-ready.mp3`
- `${AGENT_NOTIFICATIONS_ROOT}/sounds/error.mp3`

**System sounds:**
- macOS: `/System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff`, `/System/Library/Sounds/Hero.aiff`, etc.
- Linux: `/usr/share/sounds/**/*.ogg` (varies by distribution)
- Windows: Use built-in MP3s (system sounds not easily accessible)

**Supported formats:** MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG/Vorbis, AIFF

### List Available Sounds

See all available notification sounds on your system:

```bash
# List all sounds (built-in + system)
bin/list-sounds

# Output as JSON
bin/list-sounds --json

# Preview a sound
bin/list-sounds --play task-complete

# Preview at specific volume
bin/list-sounds --play Glass --volume 0.5
```

Or use the skill command: `/claude-notifications-go:sounds`

### Audio Device Selection

Route notification sounds to a specific audio output device instead of the system default:

```bash
# List available audio devices
bin/list-devices

# Output:
#   0: MacBook Pro-Lautsprecher
#   1: Babyface (23314790) (default)
#   2: Immersed
```

Then add the device name to the shared file selected by `config path`:

```json
{
  "notifications": {
    "desktop": {
      "audioDevice": "MacBook Pro-Lautsprecher"
    }
  }
}
```

Leave `audioDevice` empty or omit it to use the system default device.

### Test Sound Playback

Preview any sound file with optional volume control:

```bash
# Test built-in sound (full volume)
bin/sound-preview sounds/task-complete.mp3

# Test with reduced volume (30% - recommended for testing)
bin/sound-preview --volume 0.3 sounds/task-complete.mp3

# Test macOS system sound at 30% volume
bin/sound-preview --volume 0.3 /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff

# Test custom sound at 50% volume
bin/sound-preview --volume 0.5 /path/to/your/sound.wav

# Show all options
bin/sound-preview --help
```

**Volume flag:** Use `--volume` to control playback volume (0.0 to 1.0). Default is 1.0 (full volume).


## Manual Testing

The plugin is invoked automatically by Claude Code hooks. To test manually:

```bash
# Test PreToolUse hook
echo '{"session_id":"test","transcript_path":"/path/to/transcript.jsonl","tool_name":"ExitPlanMode"}' | \
  agent-notifications handle-hook PreToolUse

# Test Stop hook
echo '{"session_id":"test","transcript_path":"/path/to/transcript.jsonl"}' | \
  agent-notifications handle-hook Stop
```
